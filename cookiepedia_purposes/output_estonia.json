Although Google is primarily known as a search engine, the company provides a diverse range of products and services. Its main source of revenue however is advertising. Google tracks users extensively both through its own products and sites, and the numerous technologies embedded into many millions of websites around the world. It uses the data gathered from most of these services to profile the interests of web users and sell advertising space to organisations based on such interest profiles as well as aligning adverts to the content on the pages where its customer's adverts appear.","purpose":"Targeting/Advertising"},{"name":"YSC","description":"This cookie is set by YouTube to track views of embedded videos.\n","purpose":"Performance"},{"name":"VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE","description":"This cookie is set by Youtube to keep track of user preferences for Youtube videos embedded in sites;it can also determine whether the website visitor is using the new or old version of the Youtube interface.","purpose":"Targeting/Advertising"},{"name":"CONSENT","description":"This cookie carries out information about how the end user uses the website and any advertising that the end user may have seen before visiting the said website.","purpose":"Targeting/Advertising"},{"name":"wp-wpml_current_language","description":"There is not yet any general information about this cookie based on its name only.
